# final_paper_tcc
This repo contains some codes used in my final work for the undergraduation

In the *Minimal* branch is the code for porting from the BeagleBone Black to the Toradex Colibri VF61.
The porting process is in a very early stage as of 26/03/2016.

The web application relevant file structure is as follows (notice there may be more relevant files, since
I didn`t tested these are the only relevant ones):

	|-buttons.css
