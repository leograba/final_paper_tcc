# final_paper_tcc
This repo contains some codes used in my final work for the undergraduation

The *Legacy* branch specifically holds all files hosted right now in my Beagle, although I am currently not using all of it. Many approaches were abandoned along the way, so this branch is more like a log or library of the progress so far (12/02/2016).
